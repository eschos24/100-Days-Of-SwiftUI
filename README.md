# 100DaysOfSwiftUI

This is my code from working through Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

## Breakdown of the 100 days
* The first 12 days are a brief but comprehensive overview of Swift generally. 
* Days 13 - 15 are a review on what is learned in the first 12 days about Swift.
* Days 16+ are broken into groups of 2-3 normal 'Projects', a 'Challenge' for each project, and a 'Milestone Project' to review the content covered in the previous 2-3 projects. There are 19 total Projects and 6 Milestone Projects throughout the course.
